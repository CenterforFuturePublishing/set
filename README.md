Happening for Set. November 5. 2015 

Some time ago, my friend [Na](http://www.ynkim.com/) asked me to stage a performance in her exhibition titled Set. We've been talking about our work and the relationships that inspire our work. I first met Na about ten years ago in South Korea, and since then, have only kept in touch sporadically. She was living in Amsterdam and I was living in New York. Alot has happened in the past ten years. The exhibition SET is her compilation of many projects she's done and re-created into a physical installation.

We talked in depth about her process that resulted in SET. I thought about what would be the SET for my work. My practice has been all over the place. It's performance, research, writing and teaching. I knew immediately that it will be a collaboration. I asked Lauren McCarthy, who's a frequent collaborator of mine and studio mate, and Anastasis Germanidis, who was a student at SFPC earlier this year, to collaborate on a performance piece. 

The Happening for SET will be about the conversations and encounters from the Past. There will be reenactments and creative interpretation of our own works, life experiences and historic performance art works. It will be a set of happenings and moments that complete an evening of participatory performance. 

I set up the general structure of the performance, Lauren and Anastasis will each present an interesting performance that require multiple performers. I asked the students from the Performing participation class at NYU ITP to be part of the happening.  

The performance will happen between 6~8pm on November 5th, 2015 at [Doosan Gallery](http://doosangallery.com/newyork/introduction_eng.asp), 533 West 25th Street, New York, NY 10001
